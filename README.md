# THIS SCRIPT IS NO LONGER BEING USED
#### Keeping this here for documentation reasons.

The following scripts are written by Jack Chen of Hunter College.

## NOTE: 
This script is written with the intention to be run on the laptops
located at 1001E at North Building. Caution when running on other machines.

To install the script, navigate to the location of this directory. Then
enter "python3 installscript.py". 

## FLAG OPTIONS
-show            (shows all tags flagged for deletion) \
-remove [tag]    (removes a tag from the list) \
-update [tag]    (adds a new tag to the list) \
-uninstall       (deletes all related files to this script and its alias)


## MAIN FUNCTIONALITY

The main functionality of these scripts is to remove all files who's tag is 
targeted for deletion. [Default tags: .py .txt .png]
The script will delete all non-hidden files with a targeted tag in the home 
directory and all files that are one level down from the home directory.
Afterwords, the script will delete EVERYTHING(including directories) within
the Desktop, Downloads and Documents folders.

## INSTALLATION NOTES

The folder also comes with an install script, which will copy the script, into 
a hidden folder called ".127pythonscript" located at the home directory. 
Afterwards, it will add an alias command into the hidden .bash_aliases file 
located at the home directory. After closing the terminal, you should be able to 
call the main script by typing "removefiles" into the terminal.
